# GP-MPPI

This repository contains the ROS implementation of the GP-MPPI control strategy, an online learning-based control strategy that integrates the state-of-the-art sampling-based Model Predictive Path Integral [(MPPI)](https://arc.aiaa.org/doi/pdf/10.2514/1.G001921) controller with a local perception model based on Sparse Gaussian Process (SGP).

The key idea is to leverage the learning capability of SGP to construct a variance (uncertainty) surface, enabling the robot to learn about the navigable space surrounding it, identify a set of suggested subgoals, and ultimately recommend the optimal subgoal that minimizes a predefined cost function for the local MPPI planner. MPPI then computes the optimal control sequence that satisfies the robot and collision avoidance constraints. This approach eliminates the need for a global map of the environment or an offline training process.

## Software Requirements and Installation Instructions:
 Please refer to the provided guidelines in [our log-MPPI](https://github.com/IhabMohamed/log-MPPI_ros#software-requirements) repository for detailed instructions. 

## ROS Packages:

The entire project will be uploaded soon; however, we are currently referring to our related repositories for the baselines [(namely, MPPI and log-MPPI)](https://github.com/IhabMohamed/log-MPPI_ros) and [GP perception model](https://github.com/mahmoud-a-ali/vsgp_pcl).

### jackal_ros
The `jackal_ros` package contains the common packages for Jackal, including Gazebo simulator with various world definitions and their ROS launch files, robot description, messages, and controllers. 

### gp_subgoal
This package utilizes the SGP occupancy model to learn the navigable space around the robot, identifies a set of suggested subgoals, and recommends the optimal subgoal to the MPPI local planner by minimizing a predefined cost function.

### mppi_control
This node encompasses the implementation of vanilla MPPI, log-MPPI, and GP-MPPI control strategies. It subscribes to: (i) the 2D local costmap generated by the robot's onboard sensor for achieving collision-free navigation and (ii) the recommended GP-subgoal published by the gp_subgoal node. Subsequently, it publishes the control commands, specifically the linear and angular velocities of the robot.

### velodyne_simulator
URDF description and Gazebo plugins to simulate Velodyne laser scanners. If you encountered a very slow-motion of the robot in Gazebo, there are two ways to tackle this issue:
(i) you should be sure that the `gpu` parameter in [VLP-16.urdf.xacro](<xacro:macro name="VLP-16" params="*origin parent:=base_link name:=velodyne topic:=/velodyne_points organize_cloud:=false hz:=20 lasers:=16 samples:=500 collision_range:=0.2 min_range:=0.3 max_range:=5.0 noise:=0.008 min_angle:=-${M_PI} max_angle:=${M_PI} gpu:=false">) is set to `true` (we actually prefer this option), OR (ii) you can decrease the number of `samples` to let's say 500 instead of 1875 in [VLP-16.urdf.xacro](velodyne_simulator/velodyne_description/urdf/VLP-16.urdf.xacro). 

# To run GP-MPPI
1. roslaunch jackal_gazebo world_stage.launch env_name:=forest1 (0.2 tres/m2) OR maze1
2. roslaunch  gp_subgoal gp_subgoal_sim.launch
4. roslaunch mppi_control control_stage.launch gp_mppi:=true; gp_mppi:=false means that MPPI or log-mppi will be run
